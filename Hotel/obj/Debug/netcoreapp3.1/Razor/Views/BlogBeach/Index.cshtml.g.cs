                Santa Monica’s 100-year-old pier and accompanying stretch of ivory sand is arguably the
                best bit of Los Angeles. Its wide beach, powder-blue, wooden lifeguard towers and the landmark
                Ferris wheel are a stark contrast to LA’s urban sprawl.

                There’s also a popular farmers’ market, full of fresh local flavours to satisfy any foodie. But if
                dining-in is more your style, Santa Monica is peppered with irresistibly chic restaurants – and
                we’re not just talking about your average LA salad and green juice combo. This relaxed coastal
                community has a different feel than its Downtown counterpart. You can hitch a ride between Santa
                Monica and LA via Metro or enjoy the freedom of the open road by renting a car.

                A thriving art scene, bustling nightlife and miles of sandy coastline make Busan a top

                sun, look no further than Haeundae Beach, where the promenade is lined with bars and eateries.
                Looking for something more laid back? Check out the much quieter Gwangalli Beach, home to the famous
                Gwangan Bridge, which is lit up every night in kaleidoscopic hues.

                Busan is an easy destination to reach by flight, as the city has an international airport.
                Alternatively, if you’re travelling from Seoul, you can catch a high-speed train to Busan – it
                departs regularly, and the journey only takes three hours. Stay close to Haeundae Beach at Hotel
