                <p class=""text"">With so much to see in this vast country, it can be difficult to know where to start
                    when it comes to planning a trip in the United States. World-class cities, some known for history
                    and others known for fun or glamour, give visitors a broad spectrum of places to choose from. The
                    best places to visit in the United States may simply depend on your personal interests.</p>

                <p class=""text"">New York City is like no other city in the world, and one that must be experienced to be
                    fully appreciated. For first-time visitors, walking the streets can be like walking through a movie
                    set, with famous sites at every turn, from the Empire State Building, to Rockefeller Plaza, the
                    Chrysler Building, Central Park, The High Line, Times Square, 5th Avenue, Broadway, and of course,
                    the Statue of Liberty.</p>

                    are all part of what makes San Francisco such a great place to visit.

                    Take a cruise on San Francisco Bay, tour Alcatraz, drive over the Golden Gate Bridge, wander around
                    Fisherman's Wharf, or hop on a street car to explore the city sites.</p>

                <p class=""text"">The Grand Canyon is one of those must-see, bucket-list destinations that have been
                    attracting visitors for generations. Gazing out over the canyon walls to an endless horizon and an
                    unfathomable depth below is one of the highlights of any trip in the United States.

                    Visiting the Grand Canyon can easily be done on a day trip from Las Vegas or Phoenix, and from some
                    smaller cities in the vicinity, including Sedona or Flagstaff. Another option is to incorporate a
                    visit into a larger driving trip through Arizona and surrounding states. A train trip from Williams,
                    AZ is another delightful way to experience the canyon.</p>

                    been attracting visitors for decades. Huge resort complexes, with all kinds of things to see and do
                    at any time of year, have made this a destination that draws everyone, from want-to-be newlyweds who
                    come here to say their vows, to families or singles who just want to hang out around a pool.

                    Entertainment options are extensive, with some of the music industry's top stars calling Las Vegas
                    home and playing to packed audiences every night. Cirque du Soleil offers another unique experience,
                    and of course, each resort has something to entertain guests, from dancing fountains to an erupting

                    In the spring, the Cherry Blossom Festival is a beautiful time to visit, when the trees are in full
                    bloom. Summer can be hot. You may want to hit one of the beaches near Washington for a bit of a cool
                    off. Fall is also a good time, when the hot summer temperatures have cooled off enough to make
                    walking around outside very comfortable and the rush of the busy summer season has passed. In
                    winter, the crowds are definitely smaller, and the city is stunning after a fresh snowfal</p>
