                <p class=""text"">Consisting of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom (UK)
                    has long been one of Europe's most popular tourist destinations. The country's appeal has much to do
                    with its diverse scenery and rich cultural heritage. The best places to visit in the UK include
                    everything from beautifully preserved country estates and castles, to its many world-class art
                    galleries and museums.</p>

                <p class=""text"">While it's possible to plan a trip to the UK without visiting London, it's certainly not
                    to be advised. The nation's sprawling capital boasts plenty of attractions to keep you busy and
                    beautiful resorts and hotels to make you comfortable..

                    For those interested in learning more about the UK's rich history, one of the top things to do in
                    London is visit the Tower of London. Located beside the spectacular Tower Bridge on the banks of the
                    River Thames, this former palace and prison includes highlights such as the iconic 1,000-year-old
                    White Tower, with its fascinating displays of armor and weaponry, and the Jewel House, home to the
                    Crown Jewels.</p>

                <p class=""text"">One of Scotland's most attractive cities, the capital city of Edinburgh is also one of
                    the UK's most visited destinations. Popular for its many well-preserved historic buildings,
                    Edinburgh is perhaps best known as the home of the majestic Edinburgh Castle.

                    Perched high above the old city on a rocky promontory, this 13th-century royal fortress includes
                    highlights such as the famous One O'Clock Salute, held daily at Half Moon Battery, as well as the
                    Scottish Crown Jewels in the Royal Palace. Also worth seeing are the Scottish National War Memorial
                    and the famous Stone of Destiny (the Stone of Scone), only returned to Scotland after being held for
                    700 years in London.</p>

                <p class=""text"">Although one of the UK's smaller cities, Bath more than makes up for its diminutive size
                    with a multitude of things to see and do. Named after its famous Roman Baths, this beautiful city
                    has been luring visitors to its healing waters for more than 2,000 years.

                    Gushing from three hot springs, the water-known to consist of 43 different minerals, hence its
                    curative properties-travels upwards some 3,048 meters at a rate of 275,000 gallons per day, before
                    spilling out at a consistent 46.5 degrees Celsius. While it's not possible to bathe in the original
                    Roman Baths, a number of nearby spas — most notably the superb Thermae Bath Spa — offer guests the
                    chance to enjoy the city's famous waters.

                    pilgrimage for more than 4,500 years. It was believed to have been erected as a place of worship,
                    but these days, the crowds consist of tourists drawn by the sheer scale of this magnificent monument
                    to mankind's ingenuity.

                    It's a sprawling site, covering an area of more than 20 square kilometers and boasting a
                    state-of-the-art visitor center. Here, you can catch a fascinating glimpse not only into the
                    construction of Stonehenge, but also its history since then. Plan ahead and purchase a timed ticket

                    to spectacular Windsor Castle, the most famous of the UK's royal castles.

                    This grand old castle has served as the summer residence of British royalty for more than a
                    millennium. It was started by William the Conqueror in 1078, and is the world's largest inhabited
                    castle. Highlights include the splendid State Apartments containing the Queen's Gallery and dining
                    hall, each with magnificently painted ceilings and woodcarvings, and St. George's Chapel, famous as
