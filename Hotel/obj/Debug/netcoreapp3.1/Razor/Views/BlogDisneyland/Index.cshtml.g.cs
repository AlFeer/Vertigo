                <p class=""text"">Disneyland® Paris is always a good idea, especially when Disneyland® Paris is
                    celebrating 30 magical years of bringing fantasies to life. It really is a small world after all,
                    with Paris not too far from this land of heroic princesses, crafty villains and edge-of-your-seat
                    experiences – and we’re not talking about driving in Paris. So swap your berets for mouse ears as we
                    share five reasons to be a guest at Disneyland® Paris this year.</p>

                    no small feat. That’s why the park is putting on a show like no other to celebrate its anniversary
                    this year-long. The repertoire will feature new stage performances, special merchandise, and the
                    first aerial drone show ever to be performed inside a Disney Theme Park. Such as a sculpture garden

                    nose-first through the Disneyland® Park, following the scent of seasonal blooms and adventure. From
                    Frontierland to Fantasyland and everything in between, Disneyland Paris promises to be steeped in a
