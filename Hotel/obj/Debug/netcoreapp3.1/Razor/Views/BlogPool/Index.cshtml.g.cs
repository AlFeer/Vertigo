                    booking a stay where you can dip in and lounge beside your own private pool. From in-suite
                    swimming to romantic, panoramic plunge pools just outside of your window, we've found the
                    best
                    villas, hotels and cottages around the world with magical private pools.</p>

                    just outside of Siem Reap (the northwestern Cambodian town that’s known as the gateway to the
                    mystical ruins of Angkor Wat). The hotel’s villas boast private swimming pools and gardens, and
                    are all designed in keeping with the natural surroundings – clad in the finest dark wood and
                    cool, grey stone. Opt for a swim here after a day spent biking around ancient Siem Reap, or
                    simply to refresh amid the balmy tropical temperatures . Finish the day in the hotel’s
                    world-class spa, with the popular and signature spicy body wrap wellness treatment.</p>
