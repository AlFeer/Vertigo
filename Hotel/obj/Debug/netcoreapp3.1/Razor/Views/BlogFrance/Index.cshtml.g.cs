                    million visitors a year.

                    The first floor houses the Eiffel Tower 58 which extends over two levels, 58 meters above the ground
                    as its name suggests. On the second floor, the view is the best at 115 meters because you have a
                    diving view on the ground below. Finally on the 3rd floor at 275 meters, you can see what the office
                    of Gustave Eiffel was. For the more adventurous one, it is possible to use the stairs and climb the
                    steps (1,665 to the summit).
