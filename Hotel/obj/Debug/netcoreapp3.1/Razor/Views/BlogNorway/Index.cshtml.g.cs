                <p class=""text"">Norway offers visitors an incredible mix of cultural and natural wonders to explore.
                    From the country's cosmopolitan capital city of Oslo to its endless snowcapped mountain peaks and
                    deep fjords, there's no end of choices for travelers in the land of the midnight sun and stunning
                    northern lights.</p>

                <p class=""text"">The largest of Norway's more than 1,700 named fjords, Sognefjord reaches 204 kilometers
                    inland from the coastal village of Skjolden and branches off into countless smaller inlets and
                    fjords along the way. At its widest, the King of the Fjords, as it's known by Norwegians, is almost
                    five kilometers across, and the cliff walls reach as high as 1,307 meters, making a breathtaking
                    sight.

                    The most popular way to visit the fjord is by boat. Fjord cruises and sightseeing tours are
                    therefore plentiful, with many of the best tour options departing conveniently from the attractive
                    town of Bergen. But wherever you choose to embark, be sure to allow a full day for your adventure.

                    sights in Norway. It's also one of the most photographed sites in Norway.

                    Located near Stavanger, the destination requires ferry and bus rides followed by a two-hour uphill
                    hike. But once you reach the almost perfectly flat-topped cliff, situated more than 600 meters above
                    the water, you'll be rewarded with incredible views over Lysefjord.</p>

                    important role as the base for many major Arctic expeditions since the mid 1800s. The Tromsø area
                    was first settled in the 13th century as a fishing village, and the industry has been an integral
                    part of life here ever since, contributing to the area's maritime charm.

                    Also a result of its northerly position, Tromsø is one of the top destinations in the world for
                    seeing the spectacular northern lights. Tourists will find multiple attractions that explain and
                    explore the phenomenon, including Polaria, the most northerly aquarium in the world, and the Polar
                    Museum, with its interesting exhibits on Arctic exploration.</p>

                    Stream, the weather here is mild despite its location in the Arctic Circle.

                    Tourists come here to enjoy the beaches, explore traditional fishing villages, as well as to kayak
                    and hike. Many also come here to see the wildlife, a diverse array of characters, including
                    everything from eagles to moose, as well as whales. The islands are also one of the best places to
