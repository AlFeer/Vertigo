            <p class="text">
                Why choose between enjoying a city break and getting your fix of vitamin sea, when you
                can have both? These city-plus-beach destinations will have you strolling along shop-lined seafronts
                and sandy shorelines without ever having to kick off your flip-flops.

            <p class="title"><b>Santa Monica, USA</b></p>
            <img src="/assets/images/Guide/blog1/USA.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="description">Flit between LA’s bustle and seaside relaxation in Santa Monica</p>
            <p class="text">
                Santa Monica’s 100-year-old pier and accompanying stretch of ivory sand is arguably the
                best bit of Los Angeles. Its wide beach, powder-blue, wooden lifeguard towers and the landmark
                Ferris wheel are a stark contrast to LA’s urban sprawl.

                There’s also a popular farmers’ market, full of fresh local flavours to satisfy any foodie. But if
                dining-in is more your style, Santa Monica is peppered with irresistibly chic restaurants – and
                we’re not just talking about your average LA salad and green juice combo. This relaxed coastal
                community has a different feel than its Downtown counterpart. You can hitch a ride between Santa
                Monica and LA via Metro or enjoy the freedom of the open road by renting a car.

                When it comes to choosing a relaxing stay, the outdoor swimming pool at Casa Del Mar is practically
                on the beach. Laze on your retro lounger and watch the lights of the beach carnival come alive in
                the evening.

            <p class="title"><b>Busan, South Korea</b></p>
            <img src="/assets/images/Guide/blog1/Korea.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="description">South Korea’s second-largest city also boasts miles of idyllic coastline</p>
            <p class="text">
                A thriving art scene, bustling nightlife and miles of sandy coastline make Busan a top
                choice for a city-beach break. Surrounded by verdant mountains, this port city cascades towards the
                shoreline like a sea of colourful concrete, thanks to landmarks such as Gamcheon Culture Village – a
                neighbourhood known for its steep steps, twisting alleyways and rainbow-hued buildings.

                Busan also boasts some of the best bars, cafés and restaurants in South Korea. Its proximity to the
                Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan means you’ll be able to find some of the freshest seafood on the
                planet here. Rise before the sun and experience the skilful chaos that is Jagalchi Market. This is
                South Korea’s largest fish market, and you’ll be able to enjoy sea-to-table fare in many of the
                nearby restaurants.

                Beyond food, Busan also has a lively student culture and a large international community, making the
                city even more vibrant. But if you prefer taking a break from the neon-lit streets and catching some
                sun, look no further than Haeundae Beach, where the promenade is lined with bars and eateries.
                Looking for something more laid back? Check out the much quieter Gwangalli Beach, home to the famous
                Gwangan Bridge, which is lit up every night in kaleidoscopic hues.

                Busan is an easy destination to reach by flight, as the city has an international airport.
                Alternatively, if you’re travelling from Seoul, you can catch a high-speed train to Busan – it
                departs regularly, and the journey only takes three hours. Stay close to Haeundae Beach at Hotel
                Kyungsung.

            <img src="/assets/images/Guide/blog1/India.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="description">Sunsets in Goa are best enjoyed from the shores of the Arabian Sea</p>
            <p class="text">
                Though it’s actually a village, Arambol is only a short drive from Goa’s larger cities,
                and is special for its sleepy, hippie-like charm; thatched roofs cover the wooden shacks, and palm
                trees follow the curve of the coastline.

                This coconut-tree lined slice of heaven invites you to dip your toes in the warm waters of the
                Arabian Sea while enjoying a chilled out vibe that will make the sounds of India’s clamorous
                metropolises feel like a world away. Slink away into relaxation as food vendors and musicians tend
                to your senses – and watch yogis practise their devotion to nature’s deep blue beauty at sunrise
                each morning. Other popular beaches, such as Panjim, or Palolem, are easily accessible and boast
                city-style nightlife.

                Craving some cityscapes? Explore Goa’s Portuguese heritage in Panaji, the state’s capital city. It’s
                bursting with life and a patchwork of pretty architectural styles. This is especially evident in
                neighbourhoods such as Fontainhas aka the Latin Quarter. If you prefer staying city-side, check into
                the luxurious rooms of Taj Resort & Convention Centre Goa in Panaji, or drift off to the sounds of
                the crashing waves at GoYm Resort back in Arambol.

            <p class="title"><b>Wasaga Beach, Canada</b></p>
            <img src="/assets/images/Guide/blog1/Canada.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="description">
                Wasaga is the world's longest freshwater beach and just a short drive from
                Toronto
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Not far from Toronto is Wasaga Beach, the world’s longest freshwater beach, sitting on
                the shores of the Great Lakes. It was once awarded Blue Flag status, a coveted eco label reserved
                for beautiful, well-preserved beaches. The clear, shallow water and lack of tide also make Wasaga
                Beach a family-friendly escapade.

                Bars line the beach boardwalk, offering summery cocktails and food throughout the warmer months.
                This is when this Ontarian town gets into full swing, with music and beach barbecues covering the
                soft sand. The surrounding area is carved out by woodland trails, winding streams and secret
                swimming holes that will captivate your wild inner child. With Toronto just under a two-hour drive
                away, you can easily get your city fix of skyscrapers and bustling streets.

                Saga Resort has everything you might need for your city-beach holiday, including a hot tub, BBQ,
                outdoor swimming pool – and it's all only a six-minute walk from the beach.

            <img src="/assets/images/Guide/blog1/Spain.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="description">
                Explore sunbaked coastlines and tuck into world-class cuisine at San Sebastián
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Situated on the rugged coast of Northern Spain in the beautiful Basque Country is the
                city of San Sebastián. The Gothic-Basque architecture of this ancient port city creates a charming
                cityscape of picturesque landmarks flanked by idyllic stretches of sand. The deep emerald waters of
                the Bay of Biscay separate La Concha beach's crescent-moon shaped coastline from the forested hills
                on either side.

                During the reign of Queen Regent Maria Cristina, San Sebastián was the summer capital of Europe.
                Thousands used to flock to catch the sun and surf here while tucking into some truly tasty local
                delicacies. Decades later, foodies are still heading to the city to sample some of the world's
                finest gastronomic delights at any of its nine Michelin-starred restaurants. But you needn't break
                the bank to enjoy a great meal here. Enjoy a plate of pintxos – a type of local tapas – washed down
                with a refreshing glass of Txakoli, a local sparkling white wine.

                Stay in the heart of the Old Town at Pension Alameda, located within walking distance of La Concha
                and several historic squares packed with delightful eateries.
