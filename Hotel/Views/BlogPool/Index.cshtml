                <p class="text">For anyone looking for a relaxing holiday, there aren’t many better ways to wind
                    down than by
                    booking a stay where you can dip in and lounge beside your own private pool. From in-suite
                    swimming to romantic, panoramic plunge pools just outside of your window, we've found the
                    best
                    villas, hotels and cottages around the world with magical private pools.</p>

                <img src="/assets/images/Guide/blog1/image_1.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="description">Cool off in a beautiful swimming pool nestled amid natural surroundings
                </p>
                <p class="text">Templation Hotel is pure serenity and seclusion, set within palm-fringed gardens
                    just outside of Siem Reap (the northwestern Cambodian town that’s known as the gateway to the
                    mystical ruins of Angkor Wat). The hotel’s villas boast private swimming pools and gardens, and
                    are all designed in keeping with the natural surroundings – clad in the finest dark wood and
                    cool, grey stone. Opt for a swim here after a day spent biking around ancient Siem Reap, or
                    simply to refresh amid the balmy tropical temperatures . Finish the day in the hotel’s
                    world-class spa, with the popular and signature spicy body wrap wellness treatment.</p>

                <p class="description">Relax by your own infinity pool that stretches out over the sea below</p>
                <p class="text">A former military fortress turned luxury accommodation on the island of Mallorca, Cap
                    Rocat is a golden, palatial citadel of its own. Carved into the coastal cliffside, the hotel has
                    cave suites where you’ll find private infinity pools that stretch out above the waves below. It’s
                    gloriously discreet and beautifully thought-through, and a stay here will have you feeling close to
                    Mallorcan nature – just with a host of world-class amenities and opportunities to dine cliffside or
                    poolside.</p>

                <p class="description">This property’s private, turquoise plunge pools make it a place you may never
                    want to leave</p>
                <p class="text">When you choose the ‘Deluxe’ suite at Hunter’s Country House in South Africa's Western
                    Cape for a holiday, you’ll be invited into a world you may never want to leave – and the private
                    pool won’t make this any easier. The property’s thatched-roof cottages play host to grand four
                    poster beds, with a lovely family room that houses a patch of blue pool, straddled by loungers and
                    pinstriped-wicker chairs. There’s also the Deluxe Suite, where you'll find a turquoise plunge pool;
                    an equally enticing and luxurious affair. Following an afternoon of lazy swims interspersed with
                    naps in the sun, head to the lantern-lit garden for a romantic, gourmet dinner. And put your faith
                    in the staff when it comes to drink recommendations – they’ll source you something special or craft
                    their own concoction to suit your fancy.</p>

                <p class="description">Your luxury hotel with a private pool awaits</p>
                <p class="text">Clinging to Mykonos' stunning coast, the Mykonos Grand Hotel & Resort provides guests
                    with unblemished Aegean views. The hotel is designed in the classic style of the Cyclades islands –
                    think cube-shaped buildings, cerulean-blue details and white-washed walls – but ups the luxury
                    stakes with its private poolside rooms. These oases, the ‘Grand’ and ‘Deluxe’ suites, come equipped
                    with their own infinity pools. Make your way out onto the sun-baked terrace, dip into the water or
                    linger and stare at the sea and cliffs that back Ayios Yiannis beach. Follow a swim with a fresh
                    seafood meal by the private pool or hit the hotel gym.</p>

                    the larger ‘Luxury’ room and you’ll be greeted with an eggshell-coloured boudoir that opens onto a
                    garden with a sliver of blue that is your own pool. Roll out of bed straight into the water ahead of
                    a poolside breakfast, lounging on the bespoke garden furniture.</p>
