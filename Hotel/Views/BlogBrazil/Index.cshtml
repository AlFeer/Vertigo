                <p class="topic"><b>5 Best Places to Visit in the Brazil</b></p>
                <p class="text">The largest country in South America, Brazil occupies almost half the continent. Nearly
                    all of it is in the Southern Hemisphere, and much of it is tropical, with vast stretches of
                    rainforest filled with exotic plants and wildlife.

                    Brazil's 7,400-kilometer Atlantic coast is lined with golden-sand beaches, and its interior is
                    filled with mineral resources. Gold from Brazil's mines still lines the churches of Portugal, the
                    colonial power that ruled Brazil until 1822. This strong Portuguese influence is evident in Brazil's
                    colonial architecture, in decorative arts such as the glazed tiles in its churches and convents, and
                    in the language.</p>
                <p class="title"><b>Cristo Redentor and Corcovado, Rio de Janeiro</b></p>
                <img src="/assets/images/Guide/blog1/brazil-rio-de-janeiro-cristo-redentor.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="text">With arms outstretched 28 meters, as if to encompass all of humanity, the colossal Art
                    Deco statue of Christ, called Cristo Redentor (Christ the Redeemer), gazes out over Rio de Janeiro
                    and the bay from the summit of Corcovado.

                    The 709-meter height on which it stands is part of the Tijuca National Park, and a rack railway
                    climbs 3.5 kilometers to its top, where a broad plaza surrounds the statue. Completed in 1931, the
                    30-meter statue was the work of Polish-French sculptor Paul Landowski and Brazilian engineer Heitor
                    da Silva Costa, and is constructed of reinforced concrete and soapstone.</p>
                <p class="title"><b>Sugar Loaf, Rio de Janeiro</b></p>
                <img src="/assets/images/Guide/blog1/brazil-rio-de-janeiro-sugar-loaf.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="text">The easily recognized emblem of Rio de Janeiro, the rounded rock peak of Sugar Loaf juts
                    out of a tree-covered promontory, rising 394 meters above the beaches and city. Its summit is one of
                    the first places to visit for tourists, for views of Rio and the harbor, and for the thrill of
                    riding suspended in a cable car between Sugar Loaf and the Morro da Urca, a lower peak from which a
                    second cableway connects to the city.

                    Rio's first settlement began below these peaks, near the long Praia da Urca beach, and you can tour
                    one of the three early forts there, the star-shaped Fort São João.</p>
                <p class="title"><b>Iguaçu Falls</b></p>
                <img src="/assets/images/Guide/blog1/foz-do-iguacu.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="text">At the point where Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina meet, the Iguaçu river drops
                    spectacularly in a semicircle of 247 waterfalls that thunder down into the gorge below. Just above
                    the falls, the river is constricted to one-fourth of its usual width, making the force of the water
                    even stronger.

                    Some of the falls are more than 100 meters high and they cover such a broad area that you'll never
                    see all of them at once, but you do get the broadest panorama from the Brazilian side. Catwalks and
                    a tower give you different perspectives, and one bridge reaches all the way to one of the largest,
                    known as the Garganta do Diabo (Devil's Throat).</p>
                <p class="title"><b>Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro</b></p>
                <img src="/assets/images/Guide/blog1/brazil-rio-de-janeiro-copacabana.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="text">Downtown Rio's most fashionable and famous section follows Avenida Nossa Senhora de
                    Copacabana and is bordered all along one side by four kilometers of white sand and breaking surf.
                    The beach is separated from the buildings and traffic by a broad promenade paved in black and white
                    mosaic in an undulating pattern reminiscent of streets in Lisbon, Portugal.

                    The beach isn't just for show. It's also a popular playground filled with sun-worshipers, swimmers,
                    and kids building sand castles whenever the weather is fine. Stroll the streets here to find
                    restaurants, smart shops, cafés, and beautiful old buildings from the days when Rio was Brazil's
                    capital.</p>
                <p class="title"><b>Carnaval, Rio de Janeiro</b></p>
                <img src="/assets/images/Guide/blog1/brazil-rio-de-janeiro-carnival.jpg" alt="">
                <p class="text">Few shows match Rio's pre-Lenten Carnaval (Carnival) extravaganza for color, sound,
                    action, and exuberance. Make no mistake, this is not just another rowdy street party, but a
                    carefully staged showpiece, where spectators can watch the parades of competing samba dancers from a
                    purpose-built stadium designed by none other than Brazil's best-known architect, Oscar Niemeyer.

                    Called the Sambódromo, this long series of grandstand boxes provides ringside seats to a 700-meter
                    parade route where dancers and musicians from the competing samba schools strut their stuff in a
                    dazzling explosion of brilliant costumes.</p>
