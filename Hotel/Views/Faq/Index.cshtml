            <h3 class="faq-title">Where do the star ratings for hotels come from?</h3>
            <p class="faq-text">
                Star ratings are provided by the hotels themselves as well as online travel agencies
                that sell hotel rooms. HotelsCombined takes that information and displays what's most accurate. We
                understand that some of these providers are more reliable than others and take this into account
                when displaying the number of stars.

            <h3 class="faq-title">Do prices include Taxes and Fees?</h3>
            <p class="faq-text">
                All flight prices on Vertigo include applicable taxes and fees. Any
                exceptions to this are any optional fees like checked baggage or airlines that charge for seat
                selection, pet accommodations, etc. These types of add-ons will have to be arranged separately with
                your airline. Want to know what sort of fees an airline might charge?

                Train and bus prices on HotelsCombined include applicable taxes and fees. Some partners may charge
                an additional service fee, a fee for additional baggage, or a fee for certain payment methods.

            </h3>
            <p class="faq-text">
                Because we're searching hundreds of other travel sites at once, sometimes there are
                accuracy issues originating from the information we're receiving from those sites. Either the site
                isn't updating their inventory with us, has given the wrong path, or another traveler has booked the
                last available room.

                How do I find the hotel's contact details?
            </h3>
            <p class="faq-text">
                If you have already booked online and have particular requests for your stay or need
                more information like airport shuttle arrangements, you can contact the hotel using the details on
                your confirmation email or by getting in touch with your travel provider. <br>

                If you haven't booked yet and just want to know more before you make a booking, try searching for
                the hotel's website with your preferred search engine (like Google) with the hotel name and city.
                <br>

                If you can't find an answer to a specific question on our website or on the travel provider's
                website, the best thing is to contact the hotel directly as they will be your best resource.
